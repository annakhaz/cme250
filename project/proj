lasso is less flexible (sets number of coefficients equal to zero)
lasso is more interpretable (final model has response var only related to small subset of predictors)

chose bc many predictors seemed not to be correlated with age, didn't want overly flexible model to overfit data, and knew that a few predictors would be interpretable to understand the model.
